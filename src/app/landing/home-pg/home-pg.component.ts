The objective of the study was to identify trends (if any) between these factors which could help indicate why problems such as Shrinkage, Separation and Ice occur in the Iced-Coffee Drink while in market. The temperature of the Iced-Coffee Drink was modelled while exploring factors such as cabinet type, cabinet position within outlets and cabinet temperatures. The existence of whether a problem existed or not was also modelled for Shrinkage, Separation and Ice separately. The study uncovered a sense of confusion among outlets regarding the correct temperature the ice-cream cabinets should be set to - as a result, the cabinets were being set at higher temperatures leading to Iced-Coffee drinks problems."},
